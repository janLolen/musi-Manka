# musi Manka kepeken sitelen pona

Based on the official translation and on jan Poman's sitelen pona version. May have mistakes. Some things are changed.

Sitelen Pona takes up less space, so this version can use more words than the official translation does. For example, the names of potion effects are sentences instead of noun phrases: invisibility changes from "sijelo kon" to "ijo li ken ala lukin e sijelo sina". I only changed the name of the *effect*, and not the potion items. There are also small changes to individual items, like bows changing from "ilo alasa" to "ilo utala pi pana palisa". I won't change enchants as they'd take up too much space.

The characters are currently stored in an image. I plan on using a .ttf file instead, which is easier to expand upon, to include a couple of UCSUR characters that are still missing, as well as Fairfax's extra encoding for nimisin, and the sitelen telo syllable glyphs. I will also eventually adopt a different approach: instead of using a single lang file, I'll have a file with extra information that's converted into multiple versions depending on the script that needs to be used, which would make it possbile to include a sitelen sitelen version based on jan Quantum's resource pack, as well as versions with tokiponized and transcribed proper names for sitelen pona and sitelen telo.
