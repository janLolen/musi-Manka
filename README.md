# musi Manka kepeken sitelen pona

Based on the official translation and on jan Poman's sitelen pona version. May have mistakes. Some things are changed.

Sitelen Pona takes up less space, so this version can use more words than the official translation does. For example, the names of potion effects are sentences instead of noun phrases: invisibility changes from "sijelo kon" to "ijo li ken ala lukin e sijelo sina". I only changed the name of the *effect*, and not the potion items. There are also small changes to individual items, like bows changing from "ilo alasa" to "ilo utala pi pana palisa".
